# Founder Client Management System

A clean, structured **client and user management workspace** built for **non-technical B2B SaaS founders** who need to onboard users, track relationships, and stay in control — without juggling Notion, spreadsheets, inboxes, or half-built CRMs.

This project is designed as a **UI-first internal system** — focusing on clarity, trust, and operational flow rather than premature backend complexity.

---

## The Problem

As soon as founders get users or clients, things start breaking down internally:

- Client information lives in Notion, Sheets, and emails
- Onboarding status is unclear or manually tracked
- Notes and history are scattered across conversations
- Founders can’t answer: *“Where is this client right now?”*

This leads to:
- Dropped follow-ups
- Poor client experience
- Lost context
- Time wasted switching tools

For non-technical founders, this chaos compounds fast.

---

## The Solution

**Founder Client Management System** centralizes the entire client lifecycle into a single, calm workspace:

- Who the client is
- Where they are in the journey
- What’s been done
- What needs attention next

It gives founders a **clear operational view** so they can:
- Onboard users confidently
- Track progress without asking around
- Maintain context over time
- Handle client work and move on with their day

This is not a sales CRM.  
This is **founder-grade client clarity**.
